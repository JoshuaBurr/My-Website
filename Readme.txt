A program can be nested into a webpage by using a href to a different file that
can then be coded to display a bunch of functions. In this case I made pong.

off to the land fill. Now with all the plastics used today it will take up a huge percentage
of the landfill. The good part of computers though is the copper and gold that can be
recycled from them and used again to be made into new components.
